## The makeCacheMatrix function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## The cacheSolve function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the
## cacheSolve function should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
